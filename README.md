This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Dependencies

**"next": "13.4.7"
"react": "18.2.0"
"react-dom": "18.2.0"
"sass": "^1.63.6"
"@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons": "^6.4.0"
"@fortawesome/react-fontawesome": "^0.2.0"**

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## In the VS Code terminal, the following commands are frequently used:

"npx create-next-app": This command is used to set up the NextJS framework. It installs the required packages such as react, react-dom, and next.
"npm install sass": This command installs the SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) package, allowing the usage of SCSS files.
"npm install @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons" and "npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome": These commands install font packages to use Font Awesome's free solid SVG icons.
"npm run build": This command is used to build the project.
"npm run start": This command is used to start the project.
"npm run dev": This command is used to run the project in development mode.
"Ctrl + C": This command is used to stop the running project.

## Project Files:

**Note**: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is used in relevant pages, with the getServerSideProps function. The fortawesome library, .js files inside the components/icons folder, functions in the helpers/github-util.js file, and .png and .svg files inside the public/github-icons folder are imported and used.

**• pages/index.js:**

CSS styles applicable throughout the project are defined in this file and imported into _app.js.
  
**• components/layout:**
**•	layout.js:**

**•	main-header.js:**
This section includes code blocks for the layout, navigation links, and search functionality.
The handleSearch function captures the input from the search bar and redirects to the user's profile page.
CSS information is retrieved from the main-header.module.scss file.
    
**• pages/_app.js:**
To display all pages within the Layout, <Layout><Component> ... format is used.
  
**• public/github-icons:**

**•	index.js:**
The getUsers function from github-util.js is used within the getServerSideProps function.
Information from user-list.js and users-index.js files is rendered.
handleGoToPage, handleNextPage, handlePreviousPage, and handlePageNumberChange functions are defined here.
These functions handle page number changes, direct page number input, and navigation to the previous and next pages.
    
**•	[userName].js:**
This file is configured as a dynamic JavaScript file (ex: [dynamic].js).
Information from user-profile.js is rendered.
getServerSideProps function is used to organize API response information into a structured profile page.
CSS styles are retrieved from [userName].module.scss file.
    
**• components/github-api/user-list:**
**•	user-item.js:**
User information is formatted and displayed, and a button is included to redirect to the user's profile page within the site.
CSS information is retrieved from the user-item.module.scss file.
**•	user-list.js:**
